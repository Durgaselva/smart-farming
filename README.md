# Smart-Farming
Smart Farming is a machine learning–based crop recommendation system designed to help farmers make informed agricultural decisions. By analyzing soil nutrients (N, P, K) and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system predicts the top 3 most suitable crops for cultivation.

The project aims to reduce dependency on traditional trial-and-error farming methods and promote data-driven, sustainable agriculture.
